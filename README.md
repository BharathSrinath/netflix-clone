# Flow of the project
    # Created Header and Footer
        # Since there is a tint of black color along with background we have positioned Header and Central text in the Home as absolutely positioned.
        # When you get time, please learn more about absolute positioning to understand its intricacies. Faced a lot of challenges implementing it, although it looked simpler.
    # Created Home page
    # Created Login and Sign Up page as a single component which can be toggled
        # Used to firebase to help with authentication.  
    # Once authenticated, authentication function returns you the user details. We are placing the user details in a redux store to pass around the application.
